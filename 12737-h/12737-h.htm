        <h3>DOUBLING THE PART.</h3><i>Mr. S.B. B-ncr-ft, having
        retired from the Stage, thinks of taking to the Booth.</i>
        "'WHEN THE CUE COMES, CALL ME.' AW!&mdash;VERY LIKE
        HIM&mdash;VERY!"<br />


        <p>[One day last week Mr. S.B. BANCROFT wrote to the
        <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, saying, that so struck was he by
        "General" BOOTH's scheme for relieving everybody
        generally&mdash;of course "generally"&mdash;that he wished
        at once to relieve himself of £1000, if he could only find
        out ninety-and-nine other sheep in the wilderness of London
        to follow his example, and consent to be shorn of a similar
        amount. Send your cheque to 85, Fleet Street, and we'll
        undertake to use it for the benefit of most deserving
        objects.]</p>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <h2>A GOOD-NATURED TEMPEST.</h2>

    <p>It was stated in the <i>Echo</i> that, during the late
    storm, a brig "brought into Dover harbour two men, with their
    ribs and arms broken by a squall off Beachy Head. The
    deck-house and steering-gear were carried away, and the men
    taken to Dover Hospital." Who shall say, after this, that
    storms do not temper severity with kindness? This particular
    one, it is true, broke some ribs and arms, and carried away
    portions of a brig, but, in the very act of doing this, it took
    the sufferers, and laid them, apparently, on the steps of Dover
    Hospital. If we must have storms, may they all imitate this
    motherly example.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"WHAT A WONDERFUL BO-OY!"&mdash;In the <i>Head-Master's
    Guide</i> for November, in the list of applicants for
    Masterships, appears a gentleman who offers to teach
    Mathematics, Euclid, Arithmetic, Algebra, Natural Science,
    History, Geography, Book-keeping, French Grammar, Freehand, and
    Perspective Drawing, the Piano, the Organ, and the Harmonium,
    and Singing, for the modest salary of £20 a-year without a
    residence! But it is only just to add; that this person seems
    to be of marvellous origin, for although he admits extreme
    youth (he says he is <i>only three years of age!</i>) he boasts
    ten years of experience! <i>O si sic omnes</i>! So wise, so
    young, so cheap!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>If spectacular effects are worth remembering, then Sheriff
    DRURIOLANUS ought to be a member of the Spectacle-makers'
    Company.</p>

    <h2>ALICE IN BLUNDERLAND.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>On the Ninth of November.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["Our difficulties are such as these&mdash;that America
        has instituted a vast system of prohibitive tariffs,
        mainly, I believe, because ... American pigs do not receive
        proper treatment at the hands of Europe.... If we have any
        difficulty with our good neighbours in France, it is
        because of that unintelligent animal the lobster; and if we
        have any difficulty with our good neighbours in America, it
        is because of that not very much nobler animal, the
        seal."&mdash;<i>Lord Salisbury at the Mansion
        House</i>.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Real Turtle sang this, very slowly, and
    sadly:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"We are getting quite important," said the Porker to
            the Seal,</p>

            <p>"For we're 'European Questions,' as a Premier seems
            to feel.</p>

            <p>See the 'unintelligent' Lobster, even he, makes an
            advance!</p>

            <p>Oh, we lead the Politicians of the earth a pretty
            dance.</p>

            <p class="i2">Will you, won't you, Yankee Doodle,
            England, and gay France.</p>

            <p class="i2">Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
            let <i>us</i> lead the dance?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it
            will be,</p>

            <p>When they take <i>us</i> up as matters of the High
            Diplomacee."</p>

            <p>But the Seal replied, "They brain us!" and he gave a
            look askance</p>

            <p>At the goggle-eyed mailed Lobster, who was loved
            (and boiled) by France.</p>

            <p class="i2">"Would they, could they, would they,
            could they, give us half a chance?</p>

            <p class="i2">Lobsters, Pigs, and Seals all suffer,
            Commerce to advance!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"What matters it how grand we are!" his plated
            friend replied,</p>

            <p>If our destiny is Salad, or the Sausage boiled or
            fried?</p>

            <p>Though we breed strife 'twixt England, and America,
            and France,</p>

            <p>If we're chopped up, or boiled, or brained where is
            <i>our</i> great advance?</p>

            <p class="i2">Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
            chuck away a chance</p>

            <p class="i2">Of peace in pig-stye, or at sea, to play
            the game of France?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Thank you, it's a very amusing dance&mdash;<i>to
    watch</i>," said ALICE, feeling very glad that she had not to
    stand up in it.</p>

    <p>"You may not have lived much under the Sea" (said the Real
    Turtle) ("I haven't," said ALICE), "and perhaps you were never
    introduced to a Lobster&mdash;" (ALICE began to say "I once
    tasted&mdash;" but checked herself hastily, and said, "No,
    never"),&mdash;"So you can have no idea what a delightful dance
    a (Diplomatic) Lobster Quadrille is!"</p>

    <p>"I dare say not," said ALICE.</p>

    <p>"Stand up and repeat '<i>'Tis the Voice of the
    Premier</i>,'" said the Griffin.</p>

    <p>ALICE got up and began to repeat it, but her head was so
    full of Lobsters, Pigs, and Seals, that she hardly knew what
    she was saying, and the words came very queer
    indeed:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Tis the voice of the Premier; I heard him
            complain</p>

            <p>On the Ninth of November all prophecy's vain.</p>

            <p>I <i>must</i> make some sort of a speech, I
            suppose.</p>

            <p>Dear DIZZY (who led the whole world by the nose)</p>

            <p>Said the world heard, for once, on this day, 'Truth
            and Sense'</p>

            <p>(<i>I.e.</i> neatly phrased Make-believe and
            Pretence),</p>

            <p>But when GLADDY's 'tide' rises, and lost seats
            abound,</p>

            <p>One's voice has a cautious and timorous sound."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"I've heard this sort of thing so often before," said the
    Real Turtle; "but it sounds uncommon nonsense. Go on with the
    next verse."</p>

    <p>ALICE did not dare disobey, though she felt sure it would
    all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling
    voice:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I passed by the Session, and marked, by the
            way,</p>

            <p>How the Lion and Eagles would share Af-ri-ca.</p>

            <p>How the peoples, at peace, were not shooting with
            lead,</p>

            <p>But bethumping each other with Tariffs instead,</p>

            <p>How the Eight Hours' Bill, on which BURNS was so
            sweet,</p>

            <p>Was (like bye-elections) a snare and a cheat;</p>

            <p>How the Lobster, the Pig, and the Seal, I would
            say</p>

            <p>At my sixth Lord Mayor's Banquet&mdash;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"What <i>is</i> the use of repeating all that stuff," the
    Real Turtle interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on?
    It's by far the most confusing thing <i>I</i> ever heard!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Griffin; and
    ALICE was only too glad to do so.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>GAMES.&mdash;It being the season of burglaries, E. WOLF AND
    SON&mdash;("WOLF," most appropriate name,&mdash;but <i>Wolf and
    Moon</i> would have been still better than WOLF AND
    SON)&mdash;take the auspicious time to bring out their new game
    of "Burglar and Bobbies." On a sort of draught-board, so that
    both Burglar and Bobby play "on the square," which is in itself
    a novelty. The thief may be caught in thirteen moves. This
    won't do. We want him to be caught before he moves at all.</p>

    <h3>AT A SALE OF HIGH-CLASS SCULPTURE.</h3>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>An upper floor in a City Warehouse; a
        low, whitewashed room, dimly lighted by dusty windows and
        two gas-burners in wire cages. Around the walls are ranged
        several statues of meek aspect, but securely confined in
        wooden cases, like a sort of marble menagerie. In the
        centre, a labyrinthine grove of pedestals, surmounted by
        busts, groups, and statuettes by modern Italian masters.
        About these pedestals a small crowd&mdash;consisting of
        Elderly Merchants on the look out for a "neat thing in
        statuary" for the conservatory at Croydon or Muswell Hill,
        Young City Men who have dropped in after lunch,
        Disinterested Dealers, Upholsterers' Buyers, Obliging
        Brokers, and Grubby and Mysterious men&mdash;is cautiously
        circulating.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Obliging Broker</i> (<i>to</i> Amiable Spectator, <i>who
    has come in out of curiosity, and without the remotest
    intention of purchasing sculpture</i>). <i>No</i> Catlog, Sir?
    'Ere, allow me to orfer you mine&mdash;that's <i>my</i> name in
    pencil on the top of it, Sir; and, if you <i>should</i> 'appen
    to see any lot that takes your fancy, you jest ketch my eye.
    (<i>Reassuringly.</i>) I shan't be fur off. Or look 'ere, gimme
    a nudge&mdash;<i>I</i> shall know what it means.</p>

    <blockquote>

        with an inward vow to avoid his and the</i> Auctioneer's
        <i>eyes, as he would those of a basilisk.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Auctioneer</i> (<i>from desk, with the usual perfunctory
    fervour</i>). Lot 13, Gentlemen, very charming pair of subjects
    from child life&mdash;"<i>The Pricked Finger</i>" and "<i>The
    Scratched Toe</i>"&mdash;by BIMBI.</p>

    <p><i>A Stolid Assistant</i> (<i>in shirtsleeves</i>). Figgers
    <i>'ere</i>, Gen'lm'n!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Languid surge of crowd towards them.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Facetious Bidder</i>. Which of 'em's the finger, and
    which the toe?</p>

    <p><i>Auct.</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I should have thought it was
    easy to identify by the attitude. Now, Gentlemen, give me a
    bidding for these very finely-executed works by BIMBI. Make any
    offer. What will you give me for 'em? Both very sweet things,
    Gentlemen. Shall we say ten guineas?</p>

    <p><i>A Grubby Man</i>. Give yer five.</p>

    <p><i>Auct.</i> (<i>with grieved resignation</i>). Very well,
    start 'em at five. Any advance on five? (<i>To</i> Assist.)
    Turn 'em round, to show the back view. And a 'arf! Six! And a
    'arf! Only six and a 'arf bid for this beautiful pair of
    figures, done direct from nature by BIMBI. Come, Gentlemen,
    come! Seven! Was that <i>you</i>, Mr. GRIMES? (<i>The Grubby
    Man admits the soft impeachment.</i>) Seven and a 'arf. Eight!
    It's <i>against</i> you.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Grimes</i> (<i>with a supreme effort</i>).
    Two-and-six!</p>

    <blockquote>

        handkerchief.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Auct.</i> (<i>in a tone of gratitude for the smallest
    mercies</i>). Eight-ten-six. All done at eight-ten-six? Going
    ... gone! GRIMES, Eight, ten, six. Take money for 'em. Now we
    come to a very 'andsome work by PIFFALINI&mdash;"<i>The Ocarina
    Player</i>," one of this great artist's masterpieces, and an
    exceedingly choice and high-class work, as you will all agree
    directly you see it. (<i>To</i> Assist.) Now, then, Lot 14,
    there&mdash;look sharp!</p>

    <p><i>Stolid Assist.</i> "Hocarina Plier," eyn't arrived,
    Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Auct.</i> Oh, hasn't it? Very well, then. Lot 15. "<i>The
    Pretty Pill-taker</i>," by ANTONIO BILIO&mdash;a really
    magnificent work of Art, Gentlemen. (<i>"Pill-taker, 'ere!"
    from the S.A.</i>) What'll you give me for her? Come, make me
    an offer. (<i>Bidding proceeds till the "Pill-taker" is knocked
    down for twenty-three-and-a-half guineas.</i>) Lot 16, "<i>The
    Mixture as Before</i>," by same artist&mdash;make a charming
    and suitable companion to the last lot. What do you say, Mr.
    MIDDLEMAN&mdash;take it at the same bidding? (Mr. M.
    <i>assents, with the end of one eyebrow.</i>) Any advance on
    twenty-three and a 'arf? None? Then.&mdash;MIDDLEMAN,
    Twenty-four, thirteen, six.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Middleman</i> (<i>to the</i> Amiable Spectator,
    <i>who has been vaguely inspecting the "Pill-taker."</i>) Don't
    know if you noticed it, Sir, but I got that last couple very
    cheap&mdash;on'y forty-seven guineas the pair, and they are
    worth eighty, I solemnly declare to you. I could get forty
    a-piece for 'em to-morrow, upon my word and honour, I could.
    Ah, and I know who'd <i>give</i> it me for 'em, too!</p>

    <p><i>The A.S.</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). Dear me, then
    you've done very well over it.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. M.</i> Ah, well ain't the word&mdash;and those two
    aren't the only lots I've got either. That
    "<i>Sandwich-Man</i>" over there is mine&mdash;look at the work
    in those boards, and the nature in his clay pipe; and "<i>The
    Boot-Black</i>," that's mine, too&mdash;all worth twice what
    <i>I</i> got 'em for&mdash;and lovely things, too, ain't
    they?</p>

    <p><i>The A.S.</i> Oh, very nice, very
    clever&mdash;congratulate you, I'm sure.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. M.</i> I can see you've took a fancy to 'em, Sir,
    and, when I come across a gentleman that's a connysewer, I'm

    <h2>FROM OUR MUSIC HALL.</h2>

    <p>I had a fine performance at my little place last week. Gave
    the <i>Elijah</i> with a chorus whose vigorous delivery and
    precision were excellent, and except for uncertain intonation
    of <i>soprani</i> in first chorus, I think though perhaps I say
    it who shouldn't, I never heard better chorussing within my
    walls. Madame SCHMIDT-KOEHNE has a good voice, but I can't say
    I approve of her German method, nor do I like embellishments of
    text, even when they can be justified. The <i>contralto</i>,
    Madame SVIATLOVSKY (O Heavenly name that ends in <i>sky</i>!)
    is not what I should have expected, coming to us with such a
    name. Perhaps not heard to advantage: perhaps 'vantage to me if
    I hadn't heard her. But Miss SARAH BERRY brought down the house
    just as SAMSON did, and we were Berry'd all alive, O, and
    applauding beautifully. <i>Brava</i>, Miss SARAH BERRY!</p>

    <p>"As we are hearing <i>Elijah</i>," says Mr. Corner Man, "may
    I ask you, Sir, what Queen in Scripture History this young lady
    reminds me of?" Of course I reply, "I give it up, Sir."
    Whereupon he answers, "She reminds me, Sir, of the Queen who
    was BERENICÉ&mdash;'Berry-Nicey'&mdash;see?"</p>

    <p>Number next in the books. Mr. WATKIN MILLS was dignified and
    impressive as <i>Elijah</i>; but, while admitting the
    excellence of this profit, we can't forget our loss in the
    absence of Mr. SANTLEY. BEN MIO DAVIES sang the tenor music,
    but apologised for having unfortunately got a pony on the
    event,&mdash;that is, he had got a little hoarse during the
    day. "BEN MIO" is&mdash;um&mdash;rather <i>troppo operatico</i>
    for the oratorio. Mr. BARNBY bravely bâtoned, as usual. Bravo,
    BARNBY! He goes on with the work because he likes it. Did he
    not, he would say with the <i>General Bombastes</i>&mdash;</p>

    <p>I am a man stricken in years, and-well-nigh spent with
    labour, yet it behoves that, for the public good, I should take
    pen in hand, and set down the truth of those matters wherein I
    played a part. And, indeed, it may befall that, when the tale
    is put forth in print, the public may find it to their liking,
    and buy it with no sparing hand, so that, at the last, the
    payment shall be worthy of the labourer.</p>

    <p>I have never been gifted with what pedants miscall courage.
    That extreme rashness of the temper which drives fools to their
    destruction hath no place in my disposition. A shrinking
    meekness under provocation, and a commendable absence of body
    whenever blows fell thick, seemed always to me to be the better
    part. And for this I have boldly endured many taunts. Yet it so
    chanced that in my life I fell in with many to whom the cutting
    of throats was but a moment's diversion. Nay, more, in most of
    their astounding ventures I shared with them; I made one upon
    their reckless forays; I was forced, sorely against my will, to
    accompany them upon their stormy voyages, and to endure with
    them their dangers; and there does not live one man, since all
    of them are dead, and I alone survive, so well able as myself
    to narrate these matters faithfully within the compass of a
    single five-shilling volume.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>On a December evening of the year 17&mdash;, ten men sat
    together in the parlour of "The Haunted Man." Without, upon the
    desolate moorland, a windless stricture of frost had bound the
    air as though in boards, but within, the tongues were loosened,
    and the talk flowed merrily, and the clink of steaming tumblers
    filled the room. Dr. DEADEYE sat with the rest at the long deal
    table, puffing mightily at the brown old Broseley
    church-warden, whom the heat and the comfort of his evening
    meal had so far conquered, that he resented the doctor's
    treatment of him only by an occasional splutter. For myself, I
    sat where the warmth of the cheerful fire could reach my
    chilled toes, close by the side of the good doctor. I was a
    mere lad, and even now, as I search in my memory for these
    long-forgotten scenes, I am prone to marvel at my own
    heedlessness in thus affronting these lawless men. But, indeed,
    I knew them not to be lawless, or I doubt not but that my
    prudence had counselled me to withdraw ere the events befell
    which I am now about to narrate.</p>

    <p>As I remember, the Doctor and Captain JAWKINS were seated
    opposite to one another, and, as their wont was, they were in
    high debate upon a question of navigation, on which the Doctor
    held and expressed an emphatic opinion.</p>

    <p>"Never tell me," he said, with flaming aspect, "that the
    common term, 'Port your helm,' implies aught but what a man,
    not otherwise foolish, would gather from the word. Port means
    port, and starboard is starboard, and all the d&mdash;&mdash;d
    sea-captains in the world cannot move me from that." With that
    the Doctor beat his fist upon the table until the glasses
    rattled again and glared into the Captain's weather-beaten
    face.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a>
       <a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>"Hear the man," said the Captain&mdash;"hear him. A man
    would think he had spent his days and nights upon the sea,
    instead of mixing pills and powders all his life in a snuffy
    village dispensary."</p>

    <p>The quarrel seemed like to be fierce, when a sudden sound
    struck upon our ears, and stopped all tongues. I cannot call it
    a song. Rather, it was like the moon-struck wailing of some
    unhappy dog, low, and unearthly; and yet not that, either, for
    there were words to it. That much we all heard distinctly.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Fifteen two and a pair make four,</p>

            <p>Two for his heels, and that makes six."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We listened, awestruck, with blanched faces, scarce daring
    to look at one another. For myself, I am bold to confess that I
    crept under the sheltering table and hid my head in my hands.
    Again the mournful notes were moaned forth&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Fifteen two and a pair make four,</p>

            <p>Two for his heels, and&mdash;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But ere it was ended, Captain JAWKINS had sprung forward,
    and rushed into the further corner of the parlour. "I know that
    voice," he cried aloud; "I know it amid a thousand!" And even
    as he spoke, a strange light dispelled the shadows, and by its
    rays we could see the crouching form of BILL BLUENOSE, with the
    red seam across his face where the devil had long since done
    his work.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>I had forgot to say that, as he ran, the Captain had drawn
    his sword. In the confusion which followed on the discovery of
    BLUENOSE, I could not rightly tell how each thing fell out;
    indeed, from where I lay, with the men crowding together in
    front of me, to see at all was no easy matter. But this I saw
    clearly. The Captain stood in the corner, his blade raised to
    strike. BLUENOSE never stirred, but his breath came and went,
    and his eyelids blinked strangely, like the flutter of a sere
    leaf against the wall. There came a roar of voices, and, in the
    tumult, the Captain's sword flashed quickly, and fell. Then,
    with a broken cry like a sheep's bleat, the great seamed face
    fell separate from the body, and a fountain of blood rose into
    the air from the severed neck, and splashed heavily upon the
    sanded floor of the parlour.</p>

    <p>"Man, man!" cried the Doctor, angrily, "what have ye done?
    Ye've kilt BLUENOSE, and with him goes our chance of the
    treasure. But, maybe, it's not yet too late."</p>

    <p>So saying, he plucked the head from the floor and clapped it
    again upon its shoulders. Then, drawing a long stick of
    sealing-wax from his pocket, he held it well before the
    Captain's ruddy face. The wax splattered and melted. The Doctor
    applied it to the cut with deft fingers, and with a strange
    condescension of manner in one so proud. My heart beat like a
    bird's, both quick and little; and on a sudden BLUENOSE raised
    his dripping hands, and in a quavering kind of voice piped
    out&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Fifteen two and a pair make four."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But we had heard too much, and the next moment we were
    speeding with terror at our backs across the desert
    moorland.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>You are to remember that when the events I have narrated
    befell I was but a lad, and had a lad's horror of that which
    smacked of the supernatural. As we ran, I must have fallen in a
    swoon, for I remember nothing more until I found myself walking
    with trembling feet through the policies of the ancient mansion
    of Dearodear. By my side strode a young nobleman, whom I
    straightway recognised as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> the Master. His gallant
       bearing and handsome face served but to conceal the black
       heart that beat within his breast. He gazed at me with a
       curious look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"SQUARETOES, SQUARETOES," said he&mdash;it was thus he had
    named me, and by that I knew that we were in Scotland, and that
    my name was become MACKELLAR&mdash;"I have a mind to end your
    prying and your lectures here where we stand."</p>

    <p>"End it," said I, with a boldness which seemed strange to me
    even as I spoke; "end it, and where will you be? A penniless
    beggar and an outcast."</p>

    <p>"The old fool speaks truly," he continued, kicking me twice
    violently in the back, but otherwise ignoring my presence; "and
    if I end him, who shall tell the story? Nay, SQUARETOES, let us
    make a compact. I will play the villain, and brawl, and cheat,
    and murder; you shall take notes of my actions, and, after I
    have died dramatically in a North American forest, you shall
    set up a stone to my memory, and publish the story. What say
    you? Your hand upon it."</p>

    <p>Such was the fascination of the man that even then I could
    not withstand him. Moreover, the measure of his misdeeds was
    not yet full. My caution prevailed, and I gave him my hand.</p>

    <p>"Done!" said he; "and a very good bargain for you,
    SQUARETOES!"</p>

    <p>Let the public, then, judge between me and the Master, since
    of his house not one remains, and I alone may write the
    tale.</p>

    <p><i>The Children of the Castle</i>, by Mrs. MOLESWORTH
    (published by MACMILLAN), will certainly be a favourite with
    the children in the house. A quaintly pretty story of child
    life and fairies, such as she can write so well, it is valuably
    assisted with Illustrations by WALTER CRANE.</p>

    <p>GEORGE ROUTLEDGE evidently means to catch the youthful
    book-worm's eye by the brilliancy of his bindings, but the
    attraction will not stay there long, for the contents are equal
    to the covers.</p>

    <p>These are days of reminiscences, so "<i>Bob," the Spotted
    Terrier</i>, writes his own tale, or, wags it. Illustrations by
    HARRISON WEIR. And here for the tiny ones, bless 'em, is <i>The
    House that Jack Built</i>,&mdash;a paper book in actually the
    very shape of the house he built! And then there's the
    melancholy but moral tale of <i>Froggy would a-Wooing Go</i>.
    "Recommended," says the Baron.</p>

    <p>Published by DEAN AND SON, who should call their publishing
    establishment "The Deanery," is <i>The Doyle Fairy Book</i>, a
    splendid collection of regular fairy lore; and the
    Illustrations are by RICHARD DOYLE, which needs nothing
    more.</p>

    <p><i>The Mistletoe Bough</i>, edited by M.E. BRADDON, is not
    only very strong to send forth so many sprigs, but it is a
    curious branch, as from each sprig hangs a tale. The first, by
    the Editor and Authoress, <i>His Oldest Friends</i>, is
    excellent.</p>

    <p><i>Flowers of The Hunt</i>, by FINCH MASON, published by
    Messrs. FORES. Rather too spring-like a title for a sporting
    book, as it suggests hunting for flowers. Sketchy and
    amusing.</p>

    <p>HACHETTE AND CIE, getting ahead of Christmas, and neck and
    neck with the New Year, issue a <i>Nouveau Calendrier
    Perpéteul</i>, "<i>Les Amis Fidèles</i>," representing three
    poodles, the first of which carries in his mouth the day of the
    week, the second the day of the month, and the third the name
    of the month. This design is quaint, and if not absolutely
    original, is new in the combination and application.
    Unfortunately it only suggests one period of the year, the
    dog-days, but in 1892 this can be improved upon, and
    amplified.</p>

    <p>No nursery would be complete without a <i>Chatterbox</i>,
    and, as a reward to keep him quiet, <i>The Prize</i> would come
    in useful. WELLS, DARTON, &amp; GARDNER, can supply both of
    them.</p>

    <p>F. WARNE has another Birthday-book, <i>Fortune's Mirror, Set
    in Gems</i>, by M. HALFORD, with Illustrations by KATE
    CRAUFORD. A novel idea of setting the mirror in the binding;
    but, to find your fortune, you must look inside, and then you
    will see what gem ought to be worn in the month of your
    birth.</p>

    <p>WILLERT BEALE's <i>Light of Other Days</i> is most
    interesting to those who, like the Baron, remember the latter
    days of GRISI and MARIO, who can call to mind MARIO in <i>Les
    Huguenots</i>, in <i>Trovatore</i>, in <i>Rigoletto</i>; and
    GRISI in <i>Norma</i>, <i>Valentina</i>, <i>Fides</i>,
    <i>Lucrezia</i>, and some others. It seems to me that the
    centre of attraction in these two volumes is the history of
    MARIO and GRISI on and off the stage; and the gem of all is the
    simple narrative of Mrs. GODFREY PEARSE, their daughter, which
    M. WILLERT BEALE has had the good taste to give
    <i>verbatim</i>, with few notes or comments. To think that only
    twenty years ago we lost GRISI, and that only nine years ago
    MARIO died in Rome! Peace to them both! In Art they were a
    glorious couple, and in their death our thoughts cannot divide
    them. GRISI and MARIO, Queen and King of song, inseparable. I
    have never looked upon their like again, and probably never
    shall. My tribute to their memory is, to advise all those to
    whom their memory is dear, and those to whom their memory is
    but a tradition, to read these Reminiscences, of them and of
    others, by WILLERT BEALE, in order to learn all they can about
    this romantic couple, who, caring little for money, and
    everything for their art, were united in life, in love, in
    work, and, let us, <i>peccatores</i>, humbly hope, in death.
    WILLERT BEALE has, in his Reminiscences, given us a greater
    romance of real life than will be found in twenty volumes of
    novels, by the most eminent authors. Yet all so naturally and
    so simply told. At least so, with moist eyes, says your
    tender-hearted critic,</p>

        of Sunderland of robes, wigs, and cocked hats, for the
        Mayor and Town Clerk, Mr. STOREY, M.P., has sent in his
        resignation of the office of Alderman of that
        body."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. Tell us what has chanced to-day, that STOREY
    looks so sad.</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Why, there was a wig and a cocked hat offered
    him, and he put it away with the back of his hand, thus; and
    then the Sunderland Radicals fell a-shouting.</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. What was the second noise for?</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Why, for that too.</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. They shouted thrice&mdash;what was the last
    cry for?</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Why, for that too&mdash;not to mention a
    municipal robe.</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. Was the wig, &amp;c, offered him thrice?</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Ay, marry, was it, and he put the things by
    thrice, every time more savagely than before.</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. Who offered him the wig?</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Why, the Sunderland Municipality, of
    course&mdash;stoopid!</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. Tell us the manner of it, gentle CASCA.</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. I can as well be hanged, as tell you. It was
    mere foolery, I did not mark it. I saw the people offer a
    cocked hat to him&mdash;yet 'twas not to him neither, because
    he's only an Alderman, 'twas to the Mayor and Town
    Clerk&mdash;and, as I told you, he put the things by thrice;
    yet, to my thinking, had he been Mayor, he would fain have had
    them. And the rabblement, of course, cheered such an exhibition
    of stern Radical simplicity, and STOREY called the wig a
    bauble, though, to my thinking, there's not much bauble about
    it, and the cocked-hat he called a mediæval intrusion, though,
    to my thinking, there were precious few cocked-hats in the
    Middle Ages. Then he said he would no more serve as Alderman;
    and the Mayor and the Town Clerk cried&mdash;"Alas, good
    soul!"&mdash;and accepted his resignation with all their
    hearts.</p>

    <p><i>Brutus</i>. Then will not the Sunderland Town Hall miss
    him?</p>

    <p><i>Casca</i>. Not it, as I am a true man! There'll be a
    STOREY the less on it, that's all. Farewell!</p>

    <p>By some misadventure I was unable to attend the pianoforte
    recital of Paddy REWSKI, the player from Irish Poland at the
    St. James's Hall last Wednesday. Everybody much pleased, I'm
    told. Glad to hear it. I was "Not there, not there, my child!"
    But audience gratified&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"And Stalldom shrieked when Paddy REWSKI played,"</p>

    <p>"SO NO MAYER AT PRESENT FROM YOURS TRULY THE ENTREPRENEUR OF
    THE FRENCH PLAYS, ST. JAMES'S THEATRE."&mdash;It is hard on the
    indefatigable M. MAYER, but when Englishmen can so easily cross
    the Channel, and so willingly brave the <i>mal-de-mer</i> for
    the sake of a week in Paris, it is not likely that they will
    patronise French theatricals in London, even for their own
    linguistic and artistic improvement, or solely for the benefit
    of the deserving and enterprising M. MAYER. Even if it be
    <i>mal-de-mer</i> against <i>bien de Mayer</i>, an English
    admirer of French acting would risk the former to get a week in
    Paris. We are sorry 'tis so, but so 'tis.</p>

    <h2>OPERA NOTES.</h2>

    <p>What's a Drama without a Moral, and what's <i>Rigoletto</i>
    without a MAUREL, who was cast for the part, but who was too
    indisposed to appear? So Signor GALASSI came and "played the
    fool" instead, much to the satisfaction of all concerned, and
    all were very much concerned about the illness or indisposition
    of M. MAUREL. DIMITRESCO not particularly strong as the
    <i>Dook</i>; but Mlle. STROMFELD came out well as <i>Gilda</i>,
    and, being called, came out in excellent form in front of the
    Curtain. Signor BEVIGNANI, beating time in Orchestra, and time
    all the better for his beating.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"FOR THIS RELIEF MUCH THANKS."&mdash;The difficulties in The
    City, which <i>Mr. Punch</i> represented in his Cartoon of
    November 8, were by the <i>Times</i> of last Saturday publicly
    acknowledged to be at an end. The adventurous mariners were
    luckily able to rest on the Bank, and are now once more fairly
    started. They will bear in mind the warning of the Old Lady of
    Threadneedle Street, as given to the boys in the above

    <p>Of course there is nothing very new in the idea of a cripple
    loving a beautiful maiden, while the beautiful maiden bestows
    her affections on somebody else. SHERIDAN KNOWLES's Hunchback,
    <i>Master Walter</i>, is an exception to Hunchbacks generally,
    as he turns out to be the father, not the lover, of the leading
    lady. It has remained for Mr. CARTON to give us in an original
    three-act play a deformed hero, who has to sacrifice love to
    duty, or, rather, to let self-abnegation triumph over the
    gratification of self. This self-sacrificing part is admirably
    played by Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, whose simple make-up for the
    character is irreproachable. That something more can still be
    made by him of the scene of his great temptation I feel sure,
    and if he does this he will have developed several full leaves
    from his already budding laurels, and, which is presently
    important, he will have added another 100 nights to the
    run.</p>

    <p><i>Maud</i> (<i>without</i> the final "<i>e</i>") capitally
    played by Miss MAUDE (<i>with</i> the final "E") MILLETT. (Why
    didn't the author choose another name when this character was

    saying, "Come into the garden"&mdash;eh? And the author has
    already indulged his pungent humour by giving "<i>George</i>"
    <i>Addis</i> to "GEORGE" ALEXANDER. Mistake.) This character of
    <i>Maud</i> is a sketch of an utterly odious
    girl,&mdash;odious, that is, at home, but fascinating no doubt,
    away from the domestic circle. Is a sketch of such a character
    worth the setting? How one pities the future Bamfield
    <i>ménage</i>, when the unfortunate idiot <i>Bamfield</i>, well
    represented by Mr. BEN WEBSTER, has married this flirting,
    flighty, sharp-tongued, selfish little girl. To these two are
    given some good, light, and bright comedy scenes, recalling to
    the mind of the middle-aged playgoer the palmy days of what
    used to be known as the Robertsonian "Tea-cup-and-saucer
    Comedies," with dialogue, scarcely <i>fin de siècle</i>

    </div>

    <p>In Miss MARION TERRY's <i>Helen</i>, the elder of the
    Doctor's daughters, we have a charming type, nor could Mr.
    NUTCOMBE GOULD's <i>Dr. Latimer</i> be improved upon as an
    artistic performance where repose and perfectly natural
    demeanour give a certain coherence and solidity to the entire
    work. Mr. YORKE STEPHENS as <i>Mark Denzil</i> is too heavy,
    and his manner conveys the impression that, at some time or
    other, he will commit a crime, such, perhaps, as stealing the
    money from the Doctor's desk; or, when this danger is past and
    he hasn't done it, his still darkening, melodramatic manner
    misleads the audience into supposing that in Act III, he will
    make away with his objectionable wife, possess himself of the
    two hundred pounds, and then, just at the moment when, with a
    darkling scowl and a gleaming eye, he steps forward to claim
    his affianced bride, <i>Scollick</i>, Mr. ALFRED HOLLES,
    hitherto only known as the drunken gardener, will throw off his
    disguise, and, to a burst of applause from an excited audience,
    will say, "I arrest you for murder and robbery! and&mdash;I am
    HAWKSHAW the Detective!!!" or words to this effect. In his
    impersonation of <i>Mark Denzil</i> Mr. STEPHENS seems to have
    attempted an imitation of the light and airy style of Mr.
    ARTHUR STIRLING.</p>

    <p>The end of the Second Act is, to my thinking, a mistake in
    dramatic art. Everyone of the audience knows that the woman who
    has stolen the money is <i>Mark Denzil's</i> wife, and nobody
    requires from <i>Denzil</i> himself oral confirmation of the
    fact, much less do they want an interval of several
    minutes,&mdash;it may be only seconds, but it seems
    minutes,&mdash;before the Curtain descends, occupied only by
    <i>Mark Denzil</i> imploring that his wife shall not be taken
    before the magistrate and be charged with theft. This is an
    anti-climax, weakening an otherwise effective situation, as the
    immediate result of this scene could easily be given in a
    couple of sentences of dialogue at the commencement of the last
    Act. It is this fault, far more than the unpruned passages of
    dialogue, that makes this interesting and well acted play
    <i>seem</i> too long&mdash;at least, such is the honest opinion
    of A FRIEND IN FRONT.</p>

    <h3>WALK UP!</h3>

    <p>As far as Vigo Street, and see Mr. NETTLESHIP's Wild Beast
    Show at the sign of "The Rembrandt Head." Here are Wild Animals
    to be seen done from the life, and to the life; tawny lions,
    sleepy bears, flapping vultures, and eagles, and brilliant
    macaws&mdash;all in excellent condition. Observe the "Lion
    roaring" at No. 28, and the "Ibis flying" with the sunlight on
    his big white wings against a deep blue sky, No. 36. All these
    Wild Animals can be safely guaranteed as pleasant and agreeable
    companions to live with, and so, judging from certain labels on
    the frames, the British picture-buyer has already discovered.
    Poor Mr. NETTLESHIP's Menagerie will return to him shorn of its
    finest specimens&mdash;that is, if he ever sees any of them
    back at all.</p>

    <h2>IN OUR GARDEN.</h2>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:48%;">
        <a href="images/250.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>It has occurred to me in looking back over these
    unpremeditated notes, that if by any chance they came to be
    published, the public might gain the impression that the Member
    for SARK and I did all the work of the Garden, whilst our hired
    man looked on. SARK, to whom I have put the case, says that is
    precisely it. But I do not agree with him. We have, as I have
    already explained, undertaken this new responsibility from a
    desire to preserve health and strength useful to our QUEEN and
    Country. Therefore we, as ARPACHSHAD says, potter about the
    Garden, get in each other's way, and in his; that is to say, we
    are out working pretty well all day, with inadequate intervals
    for meals.</p>

    <p>ARPACHSHAD, to do him justice, is most anxious not to
    interfere with our project by unduly taking labour on himself.
    When we are shifting earth, and as we shift it backwards and
    forwards there is a good deal to be done in that way, he is
    quite content to walk by the side, or in front of the barrow,
    whilst SARK wheels it, and I walk behind, picking up any bits
    that have shaken out of the vehicle. (Earth trodden into the
    gravel-walk would militate against its efficiency.) But of
    course ARPACHSHAD is, in the terms of his contract, "a working
    gardener," and I see that he works.</p>

    <p>At the same time it must be admitted that he does not
    display any eagerness in engaging himself, nor does he rapidly
    and energetically carry out little tasks which are set him.
    There are, for example, the sods about the trees in the
    orchard. He says it's very bad for the trees to have the sods
    close up to their trunks. There should be a small space of open
    ground. ARPACHSHAD thought that perhaps "the gents," as he
    calls us, would enjoy digging a clear space round the trees. We
    thought we would, and set to work. But SARK having woefully
    hacked the stem of a young apple-tree (<i>Lord Suffield</i>)
    and I having laboriously and carefully cut away the entire
    network of the roots of a damson-tree, under the impression
    that it was a weed, it was decided that ARPACHSHAD had better
    do this skilled labour. We will attain to it by-and-by.</p>

    <p>ARPACHSHAD has now been engaged on the work for a fortnight,
    and I think it will carry him on into the spring. The way he
    walks round the harmless apple-tree before cautiously putting
    in the spade, is very impressive. Having dug three exceedingly
    small sods, he packs them in a basket, and then, with a great
    sigh, heaves it on to his shoulder, and walks off to store the
    sods by the potting-shed. Anything more solemn than his walk,
    more depressing than his mien, has not been seen outside a
    churchyard. If he were burying the child of his old age, he
    could not look more cut up. SARK, who, probably owing to
    personal associations, is beginning to develop some sense of
    humour, walked by the side of him this morning whistling
    "<i>The Dead March in Saul</i>."</p>

    <p>The effect was unexpected and embarrassing. ARPACHSHAD
    slowly relieved himself of the burden of the three sods,
    dropped them on the ground with a disproportionate thud, and,
    producing a large pocket-handkerchief, whose variegated and
    brilliant colours were, happily, dimmed by a month's use,
    mopped his eyes.</p>

    <p>"You'll excuse <i>me</i>, gents," he snuffled, "but I never
    hear that there tune, '<i>Rule Britanny</i>,' whistled or sung
    but I think of the time when I went down to see my son off from
    Portsmouth for the Crimee, '<i>Rule Britanny</i>' was the tune
    they played when he walked proudly aboard. He was in all the
    battles, Almy, Inkerman, Ballyklaver, Seringapatam, and
    Sebastopol."</p>

    <p>"And was he killed?" asked the Member for SARK, making as
    though he would help ARPACHSHAD with the basket on to his
    shoulder again.</p>

    <p>"No," said ARPACHSHAD, overlooking the attention&mdash;"he
    lived to come home; and last week he rode in the Lord Mayor's
    coach through the streets of London, with all his medals on.
    Five shillings for the day, and a good blow-out, presided over
    by Mr. AUGUSTIN HARRIS, in his Sheriff's Cloak and Chain at the
    'Plough-and-Thunder,' in the Barbican."</p>

    <p>HARTINGTON came down to see us to-day. Mentioned ARPACHSHAD,
    and his natural indisposition to hurry himself.</p>

    <p>"Why should he?" asked HARTINGTON, yawning, as he leaned
    over the fence. "What's the use, as Whosthis says, of ever
    climbing up the climbing wave? I can't understand how you
    fellows go about here with your shirt-sleeves turned up,
    bustling along as if you hadn't a minute to spare. It's just
    the same in the House; bustle everywhere; everybody straining
    and pushing&mdash;everybody but me."</p>

    <p>"Well," said SARK, "but you've been up in Scotland, making
    quite a lot of speeches. Just as if you were Mr. G.
    himself."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said HARTINGTON, looking admiringly at ARPACHSHAD,
    who had taken off his coat, and was carefully folding it up,
    preparatory to overtaking a snail, whose upward march on a
    peach-tree his keen eye had noted; "but that wasn't my fault. I
    was dragged into it against my will. It came about this way.
    Months ago, when Mr. G.'s tour was settled, they said nothing
    would do but that I must follow him over the same ground,
    speech by speech. If it had been to take place in the next day
    or two, or in the next week, I would have plumply said No. But,
    you see, it was a long way off. No one could say what might not
    happen in the interval. If I'd said No, they would have worried
    me week after week. If I said Yes, at least I wouldn't be bored
    on the matter for a month or two. So I consented, and, when the
    time came, I had to put in an appearance. But I mean to cut the
    whole business. Shall take a Garden, like you and SARK, only it
    shall be a place to lounge in, not to work in. Should like to
    have a fellow like your ARPACHSHAD; soothing and comforting to
    see him going about his work."</p>

    <p>"I suppose you'll take a partner?" I asked. "Hope you'll get
    one more satisfactory than SARK has proved."</p>

    <p>HARTINGTON blushed a rosy red at this reference to a
    partner. Didn't know he was so sensitive on account of SARK;
    abruptly changed subject.</p>

    <p>"Fact is, TOBY," he said, "I hate politics; always been
    dragged into them by one man or another. First it was BRIGHT;
    then Mr. G.; now the MARKISS is always at me, making out that
    chaos will come if I don't stick at my place in the House
    during the Session, and occasionally go about country making
    speeches in the recess. Wouldn't mind the House if seats were
    more comfortable. Can sleep there pretty well for twenty
    minutes before dinner; but nothing to rest your head against;
    back falls your head; off goes your hat; and then those Radical
    fellows grin. I could stand politics better if Front Opposition
    Bench or Treasury Bench were constructed on principle of family
    pews in country churches. Get a decent quiet corner, and there
    you are. In any new Reformed Parliament hope they'll think of
    it; though it doesn't matter much to me. I'm going to cut it.
    Done my share; been abused now all round the Party circle.
    Conservatives, Whigs, Liberals, Radicals, Irish Members, Scotch
    and Welsh, each alternately have praised and belaboured me. My
    old enemies now my closest friends. Old friends look at me
    askance. It's a poor business. I never liked it, never had
    anything to get out of it, and you'll see presently that I'll
    give it up. Don't you suppose, TOBY my boy, that you shall keep
    the monopoly of retirement. I'll find a partner, peradventure
    an ARPACHSHAD, and we'll all live happily for the rest of our
    life."</p>

    <p>With his right hand thrust in his trouser-pocket, his left
    swinging loosely at his side, and his hat low over his brow,
    HARTINGTON lounged off till his tall figure was lost in the
    gloaming.</p>

    <p>"That's the man for <i>my</i> money," said ARPACHSHAD,
    looking with growing discontent at the Member for SARK, who,
    with the only blade left in his tortoiseshell-handled penknife,
    was diligently digging weeds out of the walk.</p>

    <h2>PARS ABOUT PICTURES.</h2>

    <p>Yes, quite so. It's a very good excuse! Whenever I do not
    turn up when I am expected, my children say, "Pa's about
    pictures." It's just the same as a doctor, when he forgets to
    keep an appointment, says, "he has unexpectedly been called
    out." Yah! <i>I'd</i> call some of 'em out if I had the chance.
    I took French leave the other day, and went to the French
    Gallery, expecting to see sketches in French chalk, or studies
    in French grey. Nothing of the kind! Mr. WALLIS will have his
    little joke. The main part of the exhibition is essentially
    English, and so I found my Parisian accent was entirely thrown
    away. If it had only been Scotch, I could have said something
    about the "Scots wha hae wi' WALLIS," but I didn't have even
    that chance. Too bad, though, the show is a good one. "English,
    you know, quite English." Lots of good landscapes by LEADER,
    bright, fresh, breezy. Young painters should "follow their
    Leader," and they can't go very far wrong. I would write a
    leader on the subject, and introduce something about the
    land-scape-goat, only I know it would be cut out. Being very
    busy, sent Young Par to see Miss CHARLOTTE ROBINSON's
    Exhibition of Screens. He behaved badly. Instead of looking at
    matters in a serious light, he seemed to look upon the whole
    affair as a "screening farce," and began to sing&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Here screens of all kinds you may see,</p>

            <p class="i2">Delightful CHARLOTTE ROBINSON!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>He then folded his arms, and began to sing, "with my
    riddle-ol, de riddle-ol, de ri, de O," danced a hornpipe all
    over the place, broke several valuable pieces of furniture, and
    was removed in charge of the police. And this is the boy that
    was to be a comfort to me in my old age!</p>

    seven-and-thirty different parts, united by microscopic screws,
    are employed in the adjustment. But allow me to explain.
    [<i>Does so, giving an elaborate and confusing account of the
    construction, showing that, without the greatest care, and

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
